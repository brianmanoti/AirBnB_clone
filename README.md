AirBnB clone project 
In this project we are going to manage the following aspects:
1. initialization, serialization and deserialization
2. create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
3. create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Placeâ€¦) that inherit from BaseModel
4. create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
5. create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine.
